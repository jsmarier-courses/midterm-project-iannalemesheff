# Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

<!-- Use one hashtag symbol (`#`) to create a level 1 heading like this one. -->

## Foreword

For this assignment, you must extract data from a dataset provided by the instructor. You must then clean and analyze the data, create exploratory charts/visualizations, and find a potential story idea. Your assignment must clearly detail your process. You are expected to write about 1500-2000 words, and to include several screen captures showing the different steps you went through. Your assignment must be written with the Markdown format and submitted on GitHub Classroom.

I have been assigning different versions of this project to my digital journalism and data storytelling students for a few years now. Its structure was inspired by the main sections/chapters of [*The Data Journalism Handbook*](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one/). This version was further inspired by the [Key Capabilities in Data Science](https://extendedlearning.ubc.ca/programs/key-capabilities-data-science) program offered by the University of British Columbia (UBC).

**Here are some useful resources for this assignment:**

* [GitHub's *Basic writing and formatting syntax* page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
* [The template repository for this assignment in case you delete something by mistake](https://github.com/jsmarier/jou4100_jou4500_mpad2003_project2_template)

Did you notice how to create a hyperlink? In Markdown, we put the clickable text between square brackets and the actual URL between parentheses.

And to create an unordered list, we simply put a star (`*`) before each item.

## 1. Introduction

I will be analyzing a dataset collected by the City of Ottawa, which provides a summary of service requests made to the city in the year 2024. According to their website, the data was collected from 311 calls, the client service centre and an online self-service portal. Noteable data categories include:
* The category of the request
* Description of the request
* Dates of the request
* Status of the request

Data sources:

## 2. Getting Data

To start, import your data into Google Sheets following these steps:
1. File > Import
1. Upload your .csv file from your computer.
1. Import Location: Choose where you want your new spreadsheet to be imported. 
1. Separator Type: Since we are working with a .csv (comma-separated values), pick commas as your separators.
1. Hit the Import Data button.

Your spreadsheet should look like this.

*Figure 1: The spreadsheet when imported.*

Columns: 11
Rows: 28,539

The newly imported spreadsheet does not look very nice. At first glance, columns are not wide enough and it is hard to identify the column labels.

[Link to my sample spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZEO05kqe66DBUfp4FLY0f9Z0KFAh6NdQquYK_CJBdo8/edit?usp=sharing)

You will notice that my spreadsheet looks quite different compared to the picture. That is because I cleaned it. I will explain my cleaning techniques in the upcoming section.




Use two hashtag symbols (`##`) to create a level 2 heading like this one.

To include a screen capture, use the sample code below. Your images should be saved in the same folder as your `.md` file.

**Here are examples of functions and lines of code put in grey boxes:**

1. If you name a function, put it between "angled" quotation marks like this: `IMPORTHTML`.
1. If you want to include the entire line of code, do the same thing, albeit with your entire code: `=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)`.
1. Alternatively, you can put your code in an independent box using the template below:

``` r
=IMPORTHTML("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"; "table", 5)
```
This also shows how to create an ordered list. Simply put `1.` before each item.

## 3. Understanding Data

### 3.1. VIMO Analysis

Use three hashtag symbols (`###`) to create a level 3 heading like this one. Please follow this template when it comes to level 1 and level 2 headings. However, you can use level 3 headings as you see fit.
